- Abnormal cells = "self" signals missing
- NK cells kill cells missing "self"

**Killing Mechanisms:**
1. **Perforin/Granzyme** (like CTLs)
2. **ADCC:** Recognize antibody-coated cells (FcγRIII/CD16)
3. **TRAIL/FasL:** Death receptor pathways

**Cytokine Production:**
- IFN-γ (activate macrophages, promote Th1)

### Cellular Immunology: Advanced Concepts

#### Hematopoiesis and Lineage Commitment

**Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs):**
- Self-renew (maintain pool)
- Multipotent (give rise to all blood cells)
- ~1 in 10,000 bone marrow cells
- Can reconstitute entire hematopoietic system (bone marrow transplant)

**Lineage Commitment:**

```
HSC
  ↓
Multipotent Progenitor (MPP)
  ↓
┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
Common Myeloid Progenitor     Common Lymphoid Progenitor
(CMP)                         (CLP)
  ↓                             ↓
┌─┴─┬─────┬──────┐         ┌────┴────┐
MEP  GMP   MDP              B cell  T cell
  ↓    ↓     ↓              (bone)  (thymus)
RBC  Gran  Mono/DC
Plt  (Neu,
     Eos,
     Bas)
```

**Transcription Factor Control:**
- **PU.1 (high):** Myeloid fate
- **GATA-1:** Erythroid/megakaryocyte
- **C/EBPα:** Granulocyte
- **Pax5:** B cell commitment (master regulator)
- **Notch1:** T cell commitment
- **Id2:** NK cell development

**Cytokine Regulation:**
- **G-CSF:** Granulocyte production (used clinically for neutropenia)
- **M-CSF:** Monocyte production
- **GM-CSF:** Both granulocytes and monocytes
- **IL-7:** T and B cell development
- **IL-15:** NK cell development
- **Thrombopoietin:** Platelet production
- **Erythropoietin:** Red blood cell production

#### T Cell Development and Selection

**Thymic Architecture:**
- **Cortex:** Dense, site of positive selection
- **Medulla:** Sparse, site of negative selection
- **Thymic epithelial cells (TECs):** Present self-antigens

**T Cell Development Stages:**

```
Bone marrow progenitor → Thymus
      ↓
DN1 (CD4-CD8-) - Entry
      ↓
DN2 - β-selection checkpoint
  TCR β gene rearrangement
  Test: Does pre-TCR form?
  Pass → Proliferation, proceed
  Fail → Apoptosis
      ↓
DN3 - Pre-TCR signaling
      ↓
DN4 - Proliferation
      ↓
DP (CD4+CD8+) - Double positive
  TCR α gene rearrangement
  Express complete TCR
      ↓
POSITIVE SELECTION (Cortex)
  Test: Can TCR bind self-MHC?
  Pass → Survival signal, lineage commitment
  Fail → Death by neglect (~95% die)
      ↓
CD4+ or CD8+ SP (Single positive)
  MHC-II recognition → CD4+
  MHC-I recognition → CD8+
      ↓
NEGATIVE SELECTION (Medulla)
  Test: Does TCR bind self-antigen strongly?
  High affinity → Apoptosis OR Treg differentiation
  Low affinity → Survival, export
      ↓
Naive T cell exits thymus (~2% survive)
```

**Why Selection?**
- **Positive selection:** Ensures T cells can recognize self-MHC (MHC restriction)
- **Negative selection:** Removes self-reactive T cells (prevents autoimmunity)
- Result: T cells that recognize self-MHC + foreign peptide, but not self-MHC + self-peptide

**AIRE (Autoimmune Regulator):**
- Expressed by medullary TECs (mTECs)
- Induces expression of tissue-specific antigens in thymus
  - Insulin (pancreas)
  - Acetylcholine receptor (muscle)
  - Myelin proteins (CNS)
- Allows negative selection against tissue-specific self-antigens
- AIRE mutations → APECED syndrome (multi-organ autoimmunity)

#### B Cell Development and Selection

**Bone Marrow Development:**

```
HSC → CLP
      ↓
Pro-B cell
  Heavy chain D-J rearrangement
      ↓
Pre-B cell
  Heavy chain V-DJ rearrangement
  Pre-BCR checkpoint (μ heavy chain + surrogate light chain)
      ↓
Immature B cell
  Light chain V-J rearrangement
  Complete BCR (IgM)
      ↓
CENTRAL TOLERANCE
  Test: Does BCR bind self-antigen strongly?

  Outcomes:
  1. No binding → Proceed
  2. Weak binding → Anergy
  3. Strong binding (soluble) → Receptor editing
     (Rearrange light chain, try new specificity)
  4. Strong binding (membrane-bound) → Apoptosis
      ↓
Transitional B cell → Periphery
      ↓
PERIPHERAL TOLERANCE
  Mature B cell (IgM + IgD)
  Further checkpoints in spleen
```

**Receptor Editing:**
- Second chance for self-reactive B cells

- Develop in fetal life
- Self-renewing
- Innate-like (rapid response, low affinity, no memory)
- Produce "natural antibodies" (without infection)
- IgM antibodies against common pathogens

#### Antigen Presentation: The MHC System

**MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex):**
- Also called HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) in humans
- Most polymorphic genes in human genome
- Why? Pathogen diversity, need broad coverage

**MHC Class I (All nucleated cells):**
- **Structure:** α chain (3 domains) + β2-microglobulin
- **Peptide binding groove:** Closed ends (8-10 aa peptides)
- **Genes:** HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C

- **Peptide binding groove:** Open ends (13-25 aa peptides)
- **Genes:** HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP
- **Function:** Display exogenous antigens (phagocytosed)
- **Recognized by:** CD4+ T cells

**Polymorphism:**
- Each person inherits 3 MHC-I and 3 MHC-II from each parent
- Total: 6 MHC-I molecules, 6+ MHC-II molecules

- Population-level diversity ensures some individuals resist new pathogens

**Clinical Relevance:**
- **Transplantation:** MHC matching crucial (prevent rejection)
- **Disease associations:**
  - HLA-B27: Ankylosing spondylitis
  - HLA-DR3/DR4: Type 1 diabetes
  - HLA-DQ2/DQ8: Celiac disease

**Cross-Presentation:**
- Dendritic cells can present exogenous antigens on MHC-I
- Normally: MHC-I = endogenous, MHC-II = exogenous
- Cross-presentation allows CD8+ T cell activation against viruses that don't infect DCs
- Critical for antiviral and anti-tumor immunity

## 🔬 The Deep Dive (Master's Level)

### Advanced Cellular Immunology

#### T Cell Activation: The Immunological Synapse

**Formation of the Supramolecular Activation Cluster (SMAC):**

When a T cell encounters an APC presenting its cognate antigen, a highly organized structure forms:

**Structure (bull's-eye pattern):**

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   dSMAC (distal)        │  Actin-rich, large proteins
│   ┌───────────────┐     │
│   │  pSMAC        │     │  Adhesion molecules
│   │  (peripheral) │     │  (LFA-1, ICAM-1, talin)
│   │  ┌────────┐   │     │
│   │  │ cSMAC  │   │     │  TCR, CD3, CD4/CD8
│   │  │(central│   │     │  MHC, co-stimulatory
│   │  └────────┘   │     │
│   └───────────────┘     │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Assembly Process:**
1. **Initial contact:** TCR scanning, low affinity
2. **TCR triggering:** Conformational change, signaling begins
3. **Actin reorganization:** Cytoskeleton remodels

```

**Co-receptors Modify BCR Signaling:**

**CD19/CD21/CD81 Complex (Positive):**
- Complement-coated antigens crosslink BCR + CD21

- Tumor suppression
- Pro-inflammatory

**M2 Activation (Alternative):**

**Triggers:**
- IL-4, IL-13 (from Th2, eosinophils)
- IL-10, TGF-β
- M-CSF
- Glucocorticoids

**Signaling:**
```
IL-4 receptor → JAK1/3 → STAT6 → PPAR γ, IRF4
      ↓
Transcriptional program
```

**Characteristics:**
- High expression of:
  - Arginase-1 (depletes arginine, blocks iNOS)
  - Mannose receptor (CD206)
  - Scavenger receptors
- Anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β)
- Growth factors (VEGF, PDGF)
- Extracellular matrix proteins

**Functions:**
- Tissue repair, wound healing
- Angiogenesis
- Fibrosis
- Parasite encapsulation
- Tumor promotion (unfortunately)

**Subsets:**
- **M2a:** IL-4/IL-13, allergic responses
- **M2b:** Immune complexes + TLR, immunoregulation
- **M2c:** IL-10, tissue remodeling
- **M2d:** TLR + adenosine, tumor-associated

**Clinical Implications:**
- **Chronic infections (TB):** M2 promotes bacterial survival
- **Cancer:** Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are M2-like, promote growth
- **Wound healing:** M1 (early, clear debris) → M2 (late, repair)
- **Atherosclerosis:** M1 drives plaque inflammation

#### NK Cell Education and Licensing

**Problem:**
- NK cells kill cells lacking MHC-I
- But NK cells encounter low MHC-I cells during development
- How do they learn not to kill everything?

**Education Process:**

**1. Licensing (Arming):**
- During development in bone marrow
- NK cells that engage MHC-I via inhibitory receptors become "licensed"
- Licensed NK cells are functionally competent
- Unlicensed NK cells are hyporesponsive

**Mechanism:**
```
Inhibitory receptor (KIR, NKG2A) binds self-MHC-I
      ↓
Continuous tonic inhibition during development
      ↓
Paradoxically makes NK cell MORE responsive when inhibition is released
      ↓
Result: Licensed, functional NK cell
```

**2. Disarming:**
- NK cells that never engage MHC-I become "disarmed"
- Low killing capacity
- Prevents autoreactivity

**"Missing-Self" Refined:**
- Not just absence of MHC-I
- But absence of the SPECIFIC MHC-I that licensed the NK cell
- Self-MHC-I missing → activating signals dominate → kill

**Receptor Diversity:**

**Inhibitory Receptors (recognize MHC-I):**

**Humans:**
- **KIRs (Killer Immunoglobulin Receptors):** ~15 genes, highly polymorphic
  - KIR2DL: Bind HLA-C
  - KIR3DL: Bind HLA-A, HLA-B
- **NKG2A/CD94:** Bind HLA-E (non-classical MHC-I)

**Mice:**
- **Ly49 receptors:** C-type lectins, ~20 genes

**Activating Receptors (recognize stress ligands):**
- **NKG2D:** Binds MICA, MICB, ULBP (stress-induced)
- **NCRs (Natural Cytotoxicity Receptors):** NKp30, NKp44, NKp46
- **2B4, DNAM-1:** Adhesion/activation

**Integration:**
```
Σ(Activating signals) vs. Σ(Inhibitory signals)
      ↓
Activating > Inhibitory → KILL
Inhibitory > Activating → SPARE
```

## 🧬 The Source Truth (PhD/Expert Level)

### Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms

#### Single-Cell Immunology

**Technological Revolution:**
- Traditional: Population averages
- Single-cell: Individual cell characterization
- Reveals heterogeneity previously hidden

**Technologies:**

**1. Single-Cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq):**

**Process:**
```
Dissociate tissue → single cells
      ↓
Microfluidic capture (10x Genomics, Drop-seq)
  - Each cell in oil droplet
  - Cell lysis, mRNA capture
  - Barcoding (cell + molecular barcodes)
      ↓
Reverse transcription, amplification
      ↓
Sequencing (Illumina)
      ↓
Bioinformatics:
  - Quality control
  - Normalization
  - Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
  - Clustering
  - Differential expression
  - Trajectory inference
```

**Applications:**
- **Cell type discovery:** Find rare subsets
- **Developmental trajectories:** Precursor → effector pathways
- **Heterogeneity:** Even "same" cells differ
- **Response diversity:** Not all cells respond equally

**Example discoveries:**
- Dendritic cell subsets (cDC1, cDC2, pDC, migratory DCs)
- T cell differentiation trajectories (naive → effector/memory)
- Heterogeneity in "homogeneous" populations

**2. CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes):**
- scRNA-seq + surface protein measurement
- DNA-barcoded antibodies
- Measure transcriptome AND proteome simultaneously
- Better cell identification (proteins more stable than mRNA)

**3. scATAC-seq (Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility):**
- Map open chromatin at single-cell level
- Infer transcription factor activity
- Epigenetic states
- Regulatory elements

**4. Multimodal Single-Cell:**
- Simultaneous measurement of:
  - Transcriptome (RNA)
  - Proteome (surface proteins)
  - Epigenome (chromatin)
  - TCR/BCR sequences
- Comprehensive cell state profiling

**Challenges:**
- **Computational:** Massive datasets (millions of cells)
- **Batch effects:** Technical variation between experiments
- **Interpretation:** Correlation vs. causation
- **Cost:** Decreasing but still significant

#### Immune Cell Metabolism: Deep Mechanistic Insights

**Metabolic Reprogramming During T Cell Activation:**

**Naive T cells:**
```
Metabolic profile:
  - Glucose uptake: Low (GLUT1 low)
  - ATP production: OXPHOS (35-38 ATP/glucose)
  - Fuel: Glucose, fatty acids, pyruvate
  - mTORC1: Inactive
  - AMPK: Active (energy sensor)

Why?
  - Long-lived (years)
  - Quiescent (G0 phase)
  - Efficient ATP use
  - Minimal biosynthesis
```

**Activation → Metabolic Switch:**

```
TCR + CD28 stimulation
      ↓
PI3K → Akt → mTORC1 activation
      ↓
HIF-1α stabilization (even with O₂!)
      ↓
Transcription of glycolytic enzymes:
  - GLUT1 (glucose transporter)
  - HK2 (hexokinase)
  - PFKFB3 (rate-limiting enzyme)
  - LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase)
      ↓
Metabolic shift:
  Glucose uptake ↑ 10-20 fold
  Glycolysis >> OXPHOS (even with O₂ = Warburg effect)
  Lactate secretion ↑
  Glutamine uptake ↑
```

**Why Aerobic Glycolysis?**

```
Reasons:

1. Speed:
   Glycolysis faster ATP (no waiting for TCA, ETC)
   Supports rapid proliferation (6-8h doubling time)

2. Biosynthesis:
   Glycolytic intermediates → biosynthetic pathways:
   - Glucose-6-P → Pentose Phosphate Pathway → NADPH, ribose
     (NADPH: fatty acid synthesis, ROS for killing)
     (Ribose: DNA/RNA for cell division)
   - 3-Phosphoglycerate → Serine → Glycine, nucleotides
   - Pyruvate → Alanine, lactate

   TCA intermediates:
   - Citrate → Acetyl-CoA → Fatty acids, cholesterol
   - α-Ketoglutarate → Amino acids
   - Oxaloacetate → Aspartate → Nucleotides

3. Epigenetic regulation:
   - Acetyl-CoA → Histone acetylation (active genes)
   - α-Ketoglutarate → Cofactor for demethylases
   - NAD+/NADH ratio → Sirtuin activity

4. Effector function:
   - NADPH → ROS production (CTL killing)
   - ATP → Survival, proliferation
```

**Glutaminolysis:**
```
Glutamine (most abundant amino acid)
      ↓
Glutamate (by glutaminase)
      ↓
α-Ketoglutarate (by GDH or transaminases)
      ↓
Enters TCA cycle → Oxaloacetate
      ↓
Functions:
  - Anaplerosis (replenish TCA intermediates)
  - NADPH production (malic enzyme)
  - Biosynthesis (nucleotides, amino acids)
  - Supports proliferation

T cells highly dependent (glutamine deprivation → apoptosis)
```

**Memory Differentiation Requires Metabolic Shift:**

```
Effector T cell fate:
  High mTORC1 → High glycolysis → Effector (short-lived)

Memory T cell fate:
  Low mTORC1 → OXPHOS + FAO → Memory (long-lived)
```

**Molecular mechanisms:**

**AMPK Activation (Memory):**
```
Low nutrients / High AMP:ADP ratio
      ↓
AMPK activation
      ↓
Effects:
  - mTORC1 inhibition
  - PGC-1α activation → mitochondrial biogenesis
  - Autophagy induction
  - FAO enzymes upregulation
  - Glycolysis downregulation
      ↓
Memory phenotype
```

**mTORC1 Activation (Effector):**
```
Growth factors, amino acids, glucose
      ↓
mTORC1 activation
      ↓
Effects:
  - S6K, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation → Protein synthesis
  - HIF-1α stabilization → Glycolysis
  - SREBP activation → Lipid synthesis
  - Inhibits autophagy
      ↓
Effector phenotype
```

**Experimental Evidence:**

**Rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor):**
- Enhances memory T cell formation
- Used clinically (immunosuppressant, but context-dependent)
- Cancer immunotherapy: Rapamycin → better memory T cells

**Metformin (AMPK activator):**
- Promotes memory over effector
- Enhances vaccine responses (in mice)
- Clinical trials ongoing

**Fatty Acid Synthesis Inhibition:**
- Blocks effector differentiation
- Doesn't affect memory (they use FAO, not synthesis)

#### Tissue-Resident Immune Cells: Beyond Circulation

**Paradigm Shift:**
- Old view: Immune cells constantly circulate
- New view: Many immune cells are tissue-resident

**Examples:**

**1. Tissue-Resident Macrophages:**

**Characteristics:**
- Seed tissues during embryonic development (yolk sac, fetal liver)
- Self-maintain locally (don't need blood monocytes)
- Minimal turnover (years)
- Distinct from monocyte-derived macrophages

**Tissue-Specific Identity:**

| Tissue | Name | Unique Functions |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Brain | Microglia | Synapse pruning, neuroinflammation |
| Liver | Kupffer cells | Filter blood, remove debris |
| Lung | Alveolar macrophages | Surfactant recycling, tolerance to inhaled antigens |
| Bone | Osteoclasts | Bone resorption |
| Skin | Langerhans cells | Antigen capture, keratinocyte homeostasis |
| Gut | Muscularis macrophages | Regulate peristalsis via neurons |

**Origin:**
```
Early development:
  Yolk sac → Primitive macrophages → Seed tissues
      ↓
  Fetal liver → Definitive macrophages → Replace/supplement
      ↓
  Adult: Minimal monocyte contribution
  Self-maintenance via local proliferation
```

**Transcriptional Programming:**
- Tissue environment imprints specific gene expression
- Tissue-specific transcription factors
- Epigenetic modifications stabilize phenotype

**Example - Microglia:**
- **Unique markers:** P2RY12, TMEM119, SALL1
- **Functions:**
  - Synaptic pruning (development)
  - Neuronal debris clearance
  - Trophic support
  - Rapid response to CNS injury
- **Origin:** Yolk sac exclusively (not fetal liver or adult monocytes)
- **Turnover:** Extremely slow, self-renew locally
- **Disease:** Alzheimer's, MS, neurodevelopmental disorders

**2. Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs):**

**Discovery:**
- Lymphoid morphology
- No antigen receptors (no TCR, BCR)
- Tissue-resident (don't circulate)
- Rapid cytokine producers

**Classification (mirrors Th cells):**

| ILC Type | Transcription Factor | Cytokines | Function |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|----------|
| ILC1 | T-bet | IFN-γ | Antiviral, anti-tumor (like Th1) |
| ILC2 | GATA3 | IL-5, IL-13 | Anti-helminth, allergic (like Th2) |
| ILC3 | RORγt | IL-17, IL-22 | Antibacterial, barrier integrity (like Th17) |
| NK cells | T-bet, Eomes | IFN-γ, cytotoxicity | Kill infected/cancer cells |

**ILC2 Example (Lung):**
```
Helminth infection or allergen
      ↓
Epithelial damage → IL-33, IL-25, TSLP (alarmins)
      ↓
ILC2 activation (within hours)
      ↓
Secrete IL-5, IL-13
      ↓
IL-5: Recruit eosinophils
IL-13: Goblet cell hyperplasia (mucus), airway hyperreactivity
      ↓
Helminth expulsion (beneficial)
OR
Asthma pathology (detrimental)
```

**ILC3 Example (Gut):**
```
Microbiota signals → Mononuclear phagocytes → IL-23
      ↓
ILC3 activation
      ↓
Secrete IL-22
      ↓
Epithelial cells:
  - Antimicrobial peptides (RegIIIγ, β-defensins)
  - Mucus production
  - Tight junction proteins
      ↓
Barrier integrity maintained
Commensal bacteria controlled
```

**Development:**
- Arise from CLP (common lymphoid progenitor)
- Id2 transcription factor (blocks T/B cell fate)
- Develop in bone marrow, fetal liver
- Migrate to tissues early (perinatal)
- Expand locally

**Plasticity:**
- Can convert between subsets (ILC1 ↔ ILC3)
- Cytokine environment determines fate
- More plastic than T cells

**Clinical Relevance:**
- **Asthma:** ILC2-driven
- **IBD:** ILC1/ILC3 imbalance
- **Psoriasis:** IL-23/ILC3/IL-17 axis
- **Colorectal cancer:** ILC3 protective (IL-22)
