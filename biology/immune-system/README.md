- [ ] Innate immunity: neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells, complement
- [ ] Adaptive immunity: T cells (CD4+, CD8+) and B cells
- [ ] Antigen presentation via MHC-I and MHC-II
- [ ] B cell activation → antibody production → memory
- [ ] T cell activation requires three signals

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I get sick if I have an immune system?
Your immune system is amazing but not perfect. Pathogens evolve to evade it, and your immune system takes time to respond (days for first infection). This is why vaccines help - they train your immune system in advance!

### Why do I get the same cold multiple times?
The "common cold" is caused by >200 different viruses. Each is unique, so immunity to one doesn't protect against others. Also, some viruses (like flu) mutate rapidly.

### What is autoimmunity?
When your immune system attacks your own tissues. Normally, self-reactive cells are deleted (negative selection), but sometimes this fails or tolerance breaks down.

### How do vaccines work?
Vaccines show your immune system a "picture" of a pathogen (weakened virus, protein fragment) without causing disease. Your immune system responds, creates memory cells, and can fight the real pathogen quickly if you encounter it later.

### Why do organ transplants get rejected?
Your immune system recognizes "non-self" via MHC molecules. Donor organs have different MHC → your T cells recognize as foreign → attack. This is why MHC matching and immunosuppression are needed.

### Can you boost your immune system?
The immune system is a balanced system - too little activity = infections, too much = autoimmunity/allergies. "Boosting" isn't always good. Best support: vaccines, sleep, nutrition, exercise, stress management.

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- You make **100 billion neutrophils** every day!
- A single plasma cell makes **2,000 antibodies per second**
- Your immune system can recognize **~10¹¹ different antigens**
- Memory B cells can live for **50+ years**
- Neutrophils can **eat 20-30 bacteria** before dying
- The thymus **deletes 98% of T cells** during selection
- **Pus is mostly dead neutrophils** that died fighting bacteria
- Your gut has **more immune cells than the rest of your body combined**

## 📝 Key Takeaways

### The Big Picture
1. **Two-tiered defense:** Innate (fast, non-specific) + Adaptive (slow, specific, memory)
2. **Diversity:** ~10¹¹ unique antigen receptors from random recombination
3. **Specificity:** Each lymphocyte recognizes ONE antigen
4. **Memory:** Why you don't get measles twice, why vaccines work
5. **Tolerance:** Self-reactive cells removed (prevent autoimmunity)
6. **Balance:** Too little = infection, too much = autoimmunity/allergy

### Clinical Relevance
- **Immunodeficiency:** Missing/defective immune components → severe infections
- **Autoimmunity:** Immune system attacks self → tissue damage
- **Allergy:** Overreaction to harmless antigens → inflammation
- **Cancer immunotherapy:** Harness immune system to fight tumors
- **Vaccination:** Most successful medical intervention in history
- **Transplantation:** Managing rejection while preventing infection
