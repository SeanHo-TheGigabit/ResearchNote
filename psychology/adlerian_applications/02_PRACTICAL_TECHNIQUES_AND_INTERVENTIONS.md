### 2. Early Recollections (ER)

**What It Is:**
Exploration of earliest memories (before age 10) to understand core beliefs, values, and coping strategies. The factual accuracy is less important than the subjective meaning.

**How to Collect:**
"Think back to when you were very young, perhaps before age 8 or 9. What is one of your earliest memories? Tell me about a specific incident that you remember."

**What to Ask:**
- Most vivid part of the memory?
- Feelings during the memory?
- What were you doing? Others doing?
- How did it turn out?

**Interpretation Framework:**
- **Self-view**: How does the person see themselves in the memory?
- **Others-view**: How are others portrayed?
- **World-view**: What does the memory suggest about how the world works?
- **Coping strategies**: How did they handle the situation?

**Application Examples:**

**Memory**: "I remember being about 5, falling off my bike and scraping my knee. I cried and ran to my mom. She hugged me and put a bandage on it."
- **Interpretation**: World is safe with support; others are helpful; seek comfort when hurt
- **Useful for**: Anxiety, trust issues, attachment work

**Memory**: "I was 6, and my teacher called on me. I didn't know the answer and everyone laughed. I felt so stupid."
- **Interpretation**: World is evaluative and dangerous; I am inadequate; others are critical
- **Useful for**: Social anxiety, perfectionism, low self-esteem

### 3. Encouragement

**What It Is:**
The art of building courage, confidence, and resilience in clients. Adler believed encouragement is more powerful than praise.

**Encouragement vs. Praise:**

| Praise | Encouragement |
|--------|---------------|
| "You're so smart!" | "You worked really hard on that!" |
| "Perfect score!" | "I can see your effort paying off!" |
| "You're the best!" | "You're improving every day!" |
| Focuses on outcome | Focuses on effort and progress |
| Creates pressure | Builds resilience |
| External validation | Internal motivation |

**Techniques:**

**1. Recognize Effort and Improvement:**
- "I noticed how hard you worked on that project"
- "You've made real progress since we started"
- "That took courage to try"

**2. Focus on Strengths:**
- "You have a gift for connecting with people"
- "Your persistence is admirable"
- "You handled that difficult situation well"

**3. Separate Worth from Performance:**
- "Your value isn't determined by grades/achievement"
- "Everyone makes mistakes; that's how we learn"
- "You're worthwhile just as you are"

**4. Build on Positives:**
- "What did you do that worked?"
- "What strengths did you use?"
- "How can you build on this?"

**Application by Background:**

**For Perfectionists:** Focus on effort and courage to try imperfectly
**For Depressed Clients:** Acknowledge small steps and courage to continue
**For Anxious Clients:** Recognize bravery in facing fears
**For Children:** Encourage specific behaviors and efforts
**For Couples:** Help partners encourage rather than criticize each other

### 4. The Question

**What It Is:**
A diagnostic technique to distinguish between organic illness and psychogenic symptoms.

**How to Use:**
"If I could wave a magic wand and eliminate your symptom (anxiety/depression/phobia), how would your life be different?"

**Interpretation:**
- If life would be better with no downsides → likely organic component
- If eliminating symptom creates new problems or responsibilities → symptom may serve a purpose

**Example:**
Client with social anxiety: "If your anxiety disappeared, what would change?"
"Well, my parents would expect me to get a job and move out. They'd probably stop being so supportive."
→ Anxiety may be serving to maintain parental support and avoid adult responsibilities

**Applications:**
- Understanding secondary gains
- Identifying hidden goals of symptoms
- Motivating change by revealing costs of symptoms

### 5. Acting "As If"

**What It Is:**
Asking clients to behave "as if" they already possess desired qualities or have achieved goals.

**How to Implement:**

**Step 1: Identify Desired Quality**
"How would you like to be different?"
"More confident" / "More assertive" / "More relaxed"

**Step 2: Create Specific Scenario**
"Pick a situation this week where you can act as if you're already confident"

**Step 3: Detailed Planning**
"What would confident-you do? How would you stand? What would you say? What would your voice sound like?"

**Step 4: Practice in Session**
Role-play the scenario

**Step 5: Real-World Application**
Try it for one week

**Step 6: Process Experience**
"What happened? What did you learn?"

**Applications:**

**Career Changers:** Act as if you're already in desired role
**Socially Anxious:** Act as if you're confident in social situations
**Couples:** Act as if you're in a loving relationship
**Students:** Act as if you're a successful student

### 6. Catching Oneself

**What It Is:**
Helping clients become aware of self-defeating patterns in the moment they occur.

**Process:**

**Phase 1: Awareness Building**
Therapist helps client identify pattern:
"Notice how you apologize excessively"
"Pay attention to when you avoid eye contact"

**Phase 2: Catching in Review**
Client catches pattern after it happens:
"I realized later that I apologized when I hadn't done anything wrong"

**Phase 3: Catching in the Moment**
Client catches themselves during the behavior:
"I'm doing it right now, aren't I?"

**Phase 4: Catching Before**
Client anticipates and prevents pattern:
"I felt the urge to apologize, but I stopped myself"

**Applications:**
- Perfectionist thought patterns
- Anxious behaviors
- Depressive rumination
- Relationship dynamics
- Self-criticism

### 7. Push-Button Technique

**What It Is:**
A demonstration that we can influence our emotions by choosing which memories or thoughts we focus on.

**How to Conduct:**

**Step 1:** "Close your eyes and think of a very pleasant memory. Really immerse yourself in it."
(Wait 1-2 minutes)
"What are you feeling?"
(Client reports positive emotions)

**Step 2:** "Now think of an unpleasant or disturbing memory. Really immerse yourself in that one."
(Wait 1-2 minutes)
"What are you feeling now?"
(Client reports negative emotions)

**Step 3:** "Now go back to the pleasant memory."
(Client experiences positive emotions again)

**Teaching Point:**
"Notice how you can influence your feelings by choosing what you focus on? Your emotions aren't just happening TO you - you have some control."

**Applications:**
- Depression (rumination on negative)
- Anxiety (catastrophic thinking)
- Trauma (stuck in traumatic memories)
- Anger management
- Mood regulation

### 8. Spitting in the Soup

**What It Is:**
Making the symptom or misbehavior less attractive by revealing its hidden purpose or consequences.

**Origin:** Like making food unappealing by spitting in it - the person CAN still do it, but it's no longer satisfying.

**Examples:**

**Child Seeking Negative Attention:**
Therapist (to parent): "Every time Johnny misbehaves and you lecture him, you're giving him exactly what he wants - your undivided attention. He's found a foolproof way to get you completely focused on him."
→ Now the parent feels less compelled to lecture; Johnny's behavior is less satisfying

**Adult Procrastinator:**
"So when you procrastinate, you get to avoid the risk of trying and failing. You can always tell yourself 'I could have done well if I'd tried.' It's a perfect way to protect yourself from finding out your real abilities."
→ Makes procrastination less attractive

**Applications:**
- Resistance to change
- Secondary gains of symptoms
- Passive-aggressive behavior
- Victim mentality
- Misbehavior in children

---

### 9. Paradoxical Intention

**What It Is:**
Asking the client to exaggerate or intentionally practice the symptom they want to eliminate.

**How It Works:**
- Reduces anxiety about symptom
- Reveals client has more control than believed
- Makes symptom less automatic
- Adds humor and absurdity

**Examples:**

**Insomnia:**
"Tonight, I want you to try to stay awake all night. Fight sleep as hard as you can."
→ Often results in falling asleep

**Excessive Worry:**
"Set aside 30 minutes daily for 'worry time.' During that time, worry as intensely as possible about everything. Outside that time, postpone worries."

**Anxiety Attacks:**
"Try to make yourself have a panic attack right now. Make your heart race, make yourself sweat."
→ Usually can't produce attack on demand, showing some control

**Performance Anxiety:**
"Try to perform as badly as possible in this situation."

**Cautions:**
- Use with care and good timing
- Ensure client understands the purpose
- Not appropriate for severe conditions without modification

### 10. Natural and Logical Consequences

**What It Is:**
Allowing reality to teach rather than imposing arbitrary punishments.

**Natural Consequences:**
Automatic results of behavior without adult intervention
- Touch hot stove → get burned
- Don't eat lunch → feel hungry
- Stay up late → feel tired
- Don't study → perform poorly

**When to Allow:**
- Not dangerous
- Not interfering with others' rights
- Not too delayed to learn from

**Logical Consequences:**
Adult-arranged consequences logically related to misbehavior
- Misuse toy → lose access to toy temporarily
- Mess up room → lose privilege to have friends over
- Late for dinner → meal is over
- Hurt sibling → spend time apart

**Requirements for Logical Consequences:**
1. Related to misbehavior
2. Respectful (not punitive)
3. Reasonable (fitting the infraction)
4. Revealed in advance when possible

**vs. Punishment:**

| Punishment | Logical Consequence |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "You're grounded for a month!" | "Curfew was 10pm, you came home at midnight. Tomorrow you need to be home by 9pm." |
| Focuses on past | Focuses on future |
| Moralistic | Realistic |
| Adult imposes power | Reality teaches |
| Shame-based | Learning-based |

**Applications:**
- Parenting
- Classroom management
- Adult responsibility building
- Couples (don't rescue partner from consequences)

### 11. Values Clarification

**What It Is:**
Helping clients identify core values and align their behavior with those values.

**Process:**

"What matters most to you in life?"
"What do you want to stand for?"
"At your funeral, what would you want people to say about you?"

**Step 2: Prioritize Values**
List top 5-10 values, rank them

**Step 3: Assess Current Alignment**
"On a scale of 1-10, how well is your current life aligned with each value?"

**Step 4: Identify Discrepancies**
"Where is the biggest gap between your values and your life?"

**Step 5: Create Action Steps**
"What's one small step you could take this week to live more in line with this value?"

**Common Values Categories:**
- Relationships (family, friendship, love)

### 12. Socratic Questioning

**What It Is:**
Using questions to help clients discover insights rather than telling them directly.

**Types of Questions:**

**1. Clarifying Questions:**
- "What do you mean by that?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "How does that relate to what we were discussing?"

**2. Probing Assumptions:**
- "What are you assuming?"
- "What else could you assume instead?"
- "How could you test that assumption?"

**3. Probing Reasons and Evidence:**

- "What evidence supports that?"
- "What would someone who disagreed say?"

**4. Considering Alternatives:**

- "What if the opposite were true?"
- "How else could you handle this?"

**5. Exploring Consequences:**
- "What happens if you continue this pattern?"
- "What would be the result of that choice?"
- "How does this affect your goals?"

**6. Meta-Questions:**
- "Why is this question important?"
- "What does this tell us about your beliefs?"

**Example Dialogue:**

Client: "I can't speak up in meetings. I'm just too anxious."

Therapist: "What makes you think you can't?" (challenging assumption)

Client: "Well, I freeze up and can't think of what to say."

Therapist: "Has there ever been a time when you did speak up?" (looking for exceptions)

Client: "Actually, yes, in small team meetings I do fine."

Therapist: "What's different about those situations?" (exploring variables)

Client: "I guess I know everyone better and feel more comfortable."

Therapist: "So it's not that you can't speak up, but that comfort level matters. What would help you feel more comfortable in larger meetings?" (reframing, problem-solving)

**What It Is:**
Helping clients redirect their goals from self-defeating to constructive pursuits.
