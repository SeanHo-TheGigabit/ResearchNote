## Quick Reference Guide

### Core Adlerian Concepts (The Essentials)

| Concept | Definition | Clinical Application |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Social Interest** | Innate capacity for cooperation and community contribution | Goal of all therapy; measure of mental health |
| **Lifestyle** | Core beliefs and patterns formed in early childhood | Assessment focus; understand client's worldview |
| **Inferiority Feelings** | Universal human experience of inadequacy | Normalize; redirect toward growth |

### The Four Goals of Misbehavior (Children/Adolescents)

1. **Attention** - "Notice me" → Redirect to positive contribution

4. **Display of Inadequacy** - "Leave me alone" → Encouragement and small successes
